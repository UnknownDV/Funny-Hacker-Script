# Funny Hacker Script V1.0

This is just a fun little script I decided to write to make it look like you're
hacking something. Use this to make yourself look smarter than you are or just
to have a little fun.

# Usage:

Run the file. When prompted, put in the name of some famous database or bank.
For example, "the CIA" or "the Bank of America". When prompted again, type
either "transfer money" or "download sensitive files", according to the
supposed source.
